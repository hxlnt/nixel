A NES Sprite [CHR DATA] editor.

This is to be my Capstone Project at The Iron Yard Atlanta.

The general idea is that a user should be able to upload a ROM and then edit the Sprite [CHR] data.  i.e. Make Mario blue.
Then download a patched version of their ROM with the change.


This is currently in the exploration phase, I am able to read a ROM file and if it has CHR data then display them as sprites.


Todo:
  - ~~Read and parse ROM files~~
  - ~~Read CHR~~
  - ~~Ability to render sprites~~
  - ~~Render sprites with canvas~~
  - Read pallets
  - Read nametables
  - Pull sprites from ROMs without CHR banks, ie from PRG (Mega Man, Zelda, Metroid)
  - Write binary patch
  - Edit sprites
